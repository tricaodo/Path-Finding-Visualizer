# Path-Finding-Visualizer

This Path Finding Visualizer was built using Java. I built this because I would like to learn the different types of path finding algorithms and how they work behind the scene.

Many types of sorting algorithm:
- Dijkstra Algorithm.
- A* Algorithm.
- Breath First Search.
- Depth First Search.

Maze generation:
- Recursive Backtracking.

### Set up and Run:
1. Download the code.
2. Copy all the files in src folder to whatever IDE.
3. Run the program.

### Tutorial:
1. First left mouse click to decide the start vertex.
2. Second left mouse click to decide the end vertex.
3. Click or Drag left mouse to create the walls.
4. Right mouse to remove the walls.
5. Select the algorithm.
6. Click start and enjoy☺️.
