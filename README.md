# Path-Finding-Visualizer

This Path Finding Visualizer was built using Java and JavaSwing for UI components. I built this because I would like to learn the different types of path finding algorithms and how they work behind the scene.

Many types of sorting algorithm:
- Dijkstra Algorithm.
- A* Algorithm.
- Breadth First Search.
- Depth First Search.

Maze generation:
- Recursive Backtracking.

### Demo:

### Set up and Run:
1. Download the code.
2. Copy all the files in the src folder to whatever IDE you are using.
3. Run the program.

### Tutorial:
1. First left mouse click to decide the start vertex.
2. Second left mouse click to decide the destination vertex.
3. Click or Drag left mouse to create the walls/obstacles.
4. Right mouse to remove the walls.
5. Select the algorithm.
  - Use maze generation to set up the maze if needed.
6. Click start and enjoy☺️.

Note: Cannot delete the start or destination vertex by right mouse. Instead, click the RESET button to reset all the states.
