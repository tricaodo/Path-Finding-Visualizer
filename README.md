# Path-Finding-Visualizer

This Path Finding Visualizer was built using Java. I built this because I would like to learn the different types of path finding algorithms and how they work behind the scene.

Many types of sorting algorithm:
- Dijkstra Algorithm.
- A* Algorithm.
- Breath First Search.
- Depth First Search.
